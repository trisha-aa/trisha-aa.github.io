	<h2>Week 6 - 3D printing</h2>
		
		<p> This week we learnt about 3D printing and our exercises revolved around that.To start off the exercise we had to do was to create a chess piece.</p>

		<p>First, I drew the border which was rectangle to estimate the size of the piece. Then I found an image of a queen chess piece and got the .svg of the file.</p>

		<p>Next, I moved on to fitting the queen chess piece into the border, then i sectioned the different parts of the piece by using lines across the border.</p>

		<p>Then, I proceeded to sort of trace the svg and change it here and there to create the chess piece.</p>

		<p>This is how the clean sketch of the queen chess piece looks like. Then I use the revolve tool to form the chess piece in 3D.</p>

		<p> Then , it looked a little weird so I used the fillet tool to smoothen out the piece. Finally,  I finished off by shelling the chess piece and now it is ready for 3D printing.</p>

		<p> The image below shows the piece being printed in our school FabLab and my final 3D chess piece came out in a nice blue colour.</p>

	<h2>Week 2 - HTML/CSS</h2>
		<p> This weeks lesson was exceptionally hard for me to pick up. After learning it was how we were going to document the website, i really had lost all hope...</p>
		<p> edit : week 12 of this class and i think it isn't as bad as i thought, im still learning more things abt html and css even now</p>
		<p> There was alot to cover , so I'll just be mentioning what was useful for me here: </p>
		<h3> The extreme basics of HTML</h3>
		<p> HTML stands for hypertext markup language, it desribes the structure of a Webpage. It contains a series of elements with content in order to tell the browser how to display content.</p>

		<p>This is the structure of HTML v5 document. It shows how the content is made up of a head and a body encompassed in a html tag.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/HTML 2.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>I was still confused here but this image below helped clarify where which parts of the html i typed would appear in the website.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/HTML 3.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>After learning how to do the different sections of the website, this was my favourite part as adding the colours to the different texts helped my personalise the website even more. </p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/HTML 4.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>This was also one of my other favourite parts to learn. This was how i learned to add in an image of myself in the 'about page' of my website. This is also very useful when documenting my journey in this class as I used this to insert my images of the process.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/HTML 5.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>Then another thing i learnt was how to add a hyperlink into the website. This allows pages to be connected together and when the link is clicked , it 'jumps' to another document. This was helpful to link tutorials that helped me with class exercises and link websites that helped me with creating this website.</p>

		<p>So, I learnt that this is for displaying a webpage within a webpage and I used this in order to display the Fusion 360 creations. </p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/HTML 7.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p> All in all, HTML was extremely confusing and something new for me but i think after a while it got easier to pick up and the tips from our class slides helped my understanding in HTML creation.</p>
		
		<h3> CSS </h3>
		<p>The layout is made of semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page such as the ones listed in the image below.It helps to clearly describe the meaning to both the browser and developers.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/Sectioning .png" width="350" alt=""/>
		<p>The image belows shows the typical page breakdown. It think showing the comparison between the drafting of a page and the actual way it is written out in the html. </p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/typical page breakdown.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>To start off CSS, they stand for cascading style sheets. I learned that this is how the HTML elements are displayed and overall it controls how the layout looks like.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/CSS start.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>CSS Rule Syntax: For me to understand how to form the CSS, i had to understand the breakdown of CSS. The selector helps to identify the HTML element to style and the declaration block holds the formatting.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/CSS rule.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>So this next part helped me a little more when using CSS. It helped show how using the id selector would make a part of the page more unique.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/id selector.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>This part was actually super helpful for me as i was able to create a navigation bar for my own webpage. I used the typed out CSS and changed it here and there in order to form my version of a navigation bar.</p>
		<img src="HTML , CSS/navigation bar.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p> So this covers the basics of HTML and CSS that i just learned for this class.</p>

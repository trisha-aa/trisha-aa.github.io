	<h2>Week 2 - HTML/CSS</h2>
		<p> This weeks lesson was exceptionally hard for me to pick up. After learning it was how we were going to document the website, i really had lost all hope...</p>
		<p> edit : week 12 of this class and i think it isn't as bad as i thought, im still learning more things abt html and css even now</p>
		<p> There was alot to cover , so I'll just be mentioning what was useful for me here: </p>
		<h3> The extreme basics of HTML</h3>
		<p> HTML stands for hypertext markup language, it desribes the structure of a Webpage. It contains a series of elements with content in order to tell the browser how to display content.</p>
		<img src="SRC/HTML , CSS/HTML 1.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>This is the structure of HTML v5 document. It shows how the content is made up of a head and a body encompassed in a html tag.</p>

		<p>I was still confused here but this image below helped clarify where which parts of the html i typed would appear in the website.</p>

		<p>After learning how to do the different sections of the website, this was my favourite part as adding the colours to the different texts helped my personalise the website even more. </p>
		<img src="SRC/HTML , CSS/HTML 4.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>This was also one of my other favourite parts to learn. This was how i learned to add in an image of myself in the 'about page' of my website. This is also very useful when documenting my journey in this class as I used this to insert my images of the process.</p>
		<img src="SRC/HTML , CSS/HTML 5.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>Then another thing i learnt was how to add a hyperlink into the website. This allows pages to be connected together and when the link is clicked , it 'jumps' to another document. This was helpful to link tutorials that helped me with class exercises and link websites that helped me with creating this website.</p>
		<img src="SRC/HTML , CSS/HTML 6.png" width="800" alt=""/>
		<p>So, I learnt that this is for displaying a webpage within a webpage and I used this in order to display the Fusion 360 creations. </p>

		<p> All in all, HTML was extremely confusing and something new for me but i think after a while it got easier to pick up and the tips from our class slides helped my understanding in HTML creation.</p>
		
		<h3> CSS </h3>

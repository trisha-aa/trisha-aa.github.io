	<h3>Exercise 5 - Fusion 360 Lego Brick</h3>
	<p>Building on the fusion exercises done last week, the exercises got a little more difficult. To start off this week, we had to make a lego brick in Fusion 360. Below show the specific dimensions used in this exercise. </p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-09 211402.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>First, I drew out a rectangle follwing the dimensions given, which was 31.80mm by 15.80mm</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170631.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Then, using the extrude function, I created a block like this.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170641.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Next, I drew out the circles using sketch.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170714.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Similarly, these circles were then made into 3d using the extrude function. This forms the basic shape of the lego block, however, i was not done yet.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170722.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Turning to the underside of the block, I had to ensure that it was not just a solid block so i clicked the shell function to create what is seen in the image below.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170737.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>After that, I still had to continue with the inside of the lego , this is where they are able to click with one another. I again used the sketch function to form the circles and then used the offset button to create the smaller circles as seen.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170752.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Again , like the other two times , I extruded the spaces between the two circles to form this.</p>
	<img src="lego brick/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170806.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Finally, to finish off this brick, i used the fillet function to smoothen the corners of the lego brick so that they were not too sharp. And this is the final outcome !!</p>

	<h3 id="middle"> Exercise 6 - Fusion 360 Name Tag </h3>
	<p>The next exercise of this week is this name tag . The dimensions are shown in the image below.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 211350.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>To start off, I created this with the sketch function. The bigger part was made by using a rectangle and two circles at the sides, then using the trim function to combine it . After that the smaller circle was added separately. To achieve the result seen in the screenshot, the offset function was used.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205334.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Then , I just simply used the extrude button for this.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205347.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>I then redrew the offset part on the extrude part to continue with the next step.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205358.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Again, I then extruded the sketch from before.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205420.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>After so , the name was added in , or in this case the label of FabLab.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205456.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Of course, then the extrude button was used again to produce this final result.</p>
	<img src="name tag/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205518.png" width="850" alt=""/>

		<p>Through this exercise, I was able to pick up adding text to my designs , I also referred to this video for more help: </p>

	<h3 id="bottom"> Exercise 7 - Fusion 360 20 Cube Tower</h3>
	<p>The third exercise for this week was to create a 20 cube tower and shell it. The first image here shows the dimension used to draw it.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-09 211411.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>The first step here was creating the base of the entire tower in sketches.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170918.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Of course, my favourite tool, extruding is used here.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170931.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>I then repeated the process of drawing the sketch on top of the extruded portion.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170939.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>And again , extruding that sketch.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170946.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Once more, creating the next sketch on top of the part that is extruded.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170953.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Extruding that sketch again ...</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 170959.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Finally, that last cube to be drawn on the top of the tower.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 171013.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Extruding one last time here to form the tower.</p>
	<img src="cube tower/Screenshot 2023-07-08 171028.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Then, selecting the tower and the shell tool in order to create a hollow inside as seen in the image below. This is the final product that I achieved. yay!!</p>

	<h3 id="end">Exercise 8 - Fusion 360 Mug with Handle</h3>
	<p>Okay for the final exercise done this week, it is a mug with a handle. This one was a little more tricky compared to the other three done. Like the ones above, the dimensions are stated in the image below.</p>
	<img src="mug with handle/Screenshot 2023-07-09 211423.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>To start of , a section of the mug was drawn . Or more specifically, half of a section was drawn. I used sketch to draw this out again.The line and arc tool was used here to create this section.</p>
	<img src="mug with handle/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205049.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>So here, this time instead of the extrude tool, I used the revolve tool to form this sort of cylinder shape as seen.</p>
	<img src="mug with handle/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205104.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Next, I created the handle by sketching with lines and arcs again. The offset tool was also used here.</p>
	<img src="mug with handle/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205142.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Back to the extrude tool again, the handle of the mug was formed.</p>
	<img src="mug with handle/Screenshot 2023-07-09 205205.png" width="850" alt=""/>
	<p>Finally , I formed the final mug by combining the handle part with the cup part of the mug. This is the final result.</p>

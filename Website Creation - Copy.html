	<h2> Website Creation</h2>
	<div> 
		<p>Here I'll be documenting how i came about creating this website. To be honest, it took quite a while and i was mostly confused throughout the process and relied on class slides as well as online information.</p>
		<p>Okay so i started off with the simple stuff like adding my title and adding my navigation.</p>

		<p> I had based the start on what was given in the lesson slides for the navigation.</p>

		<p>Then i added my 'about me' section as well as a cat image that i did.</p>

		<p>Also I was kind of unsure how to put the background so i used this link</p>

	<h2>Weekly documentation</h2>
		<p>So for the documentation part, i wanted to find ways to organise my content according to the weeks.So i went online to find how to do so.</p>

		<p>It helped me section out and split up the week's work to achieve this look!</p>

		<p> After completing week 3 content, i realised how tiring it would be to have to scroll all the way down one long page. So i searched online to find for ways to create a shortcut.</p>

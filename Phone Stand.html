  <p>For this assignment, we had to create a phone stand and here below documents my process in creating one. This image shows the requirement of the assignment. </p>

			 <p>The First step i did was to draw out the rough shape of the phone stand using sketch. Then I used the extrude feature to make it turn from a 2D drawing into a 3D model.</p>

		<p>Next, I wanted to add a design to it, I went with a start shape and drew it on the back of the phone holder using sketch and then with the help of extrude , I made a one in the shape of a star.</p>

		<p> Then , I wanted to add a more useful function to it, thus I came up with the idea of putting sort of a hanger for wired earpieces. Similarly, I used sketch and extrude to create this.</p>

		<p> After this, I created a portion at the front of the phone holder for where the charger can be plugged into the phone. Again , this was done with the sketch and extrude function.</p>

		<p> Then, grooves were added for more details as well as another star on the base of the phone holder.</p>

		<p> To finish off this model, I used the fillet tool to round off any sharp edges.</p>

		<p> This is how it looks like after 3D printing</p>

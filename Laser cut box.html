	<h2>Laser Cut Box</h2>
		<p>For this weeks class, we had to design and build a laser cut box. The specific requirements are here below:</p>

	<p>Firstly, I sketched and extruded the sketch to form the base of the box.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 232808.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p> The next step was to create the sides of the box, similary I sketched it out and then used the extrude tool. This is how I formed the longer sides of the box.</p>

	<p>After this, I did the shorter sides of the box using the same steps.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 232916.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>As seen here, i used the cut tool in order to cut the slots into the sides, this way the components could fit each other after laser cutting.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 232925.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>Then, I had to create the middle section of the box , this was to create a portion for where my drawer was going to go.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233016.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>After creating the middle section, I cut a rectangle out the front of the box in order to form an opening for the drawer.Then using the same dimensions to ce=ut the rectangle, I drew out the front of the drawer.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233121.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>Then I used the extruding tool to form the front. Similarly, I used the sketch and extrude again for the sides of the drawer.</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233145.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>To finish off the drawer, i added in the back and base of the drawer, making sure that I also cut out the extra parts that overlapped.Then i sketched a handle using lines and arcs.</p>
	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233200.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233218.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>I completed the handle by extruding it and even cut slot holes for the handle to fit into the drawer front. Next, I moved on to get more creative with the exterior of the box.I added these designs as an .svg</p>

	<img src="SRC/accessory box/Screenshot 2023-07-11 233344.png" width="450" alt=""/>
	<p>Then I had to create the opening of the box. I decided to go with flaps on the top.I sketched out how i wanted it to look like and then brought it to life with the extrude function.</p>

	<p>I initially forgot to add the hinges, so I added it for the opening of the box afterwards.</p>

	<p>After laser cutting, this is how the box looked like in real life!!</p>

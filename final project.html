				<p> Here I will be documenting my process for the final project of this module. First, I had to brainstorm on what i wanted to do, here are some early concepts and rough ideas i came up with ,to begin.</p>
				<img src= "brainstorm" width="800" alt=""/>
			<p> After considering the ideas , i ulitmately decided to go with the pinball machine , however, some of the concepts here were changed later on.As i went deeper into strengthening my concept, i started to be more specific on different parts.Using what we learnt in class ( Syntactic, Pragmatic and Semantic Analysis) , i created this vision board of how the pinball was going to look.</p>

				<p> The next step was to establish the parts that i would need in order to pull this off as well as the rough step to take.</p>

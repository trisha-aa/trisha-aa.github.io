	<h2>Week 3 - 2D/3D CAD</h2>
  <p>This week we started to learn how to illustrate using 2D and 3D CAD. Here, I'll be sharing my learning proccess with these new softwares.Before i forget, the softwares I'll be using is Gimp and Inkscape for 2D and Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D. </p>
	<h3>2D - Gimp</h3>
  <p>This is the original group photo that i will be working with.The assignment is raster editing with gimp, where i will be removing the background and resizing image to a width of 1280.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/group photo.jpg" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 1 - To start off, I created a new image and changed the width size to 1280px </p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/gstep1.png" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 2 - Next, i used the free select tool and started to trace the image of myself. I ensured to remain slightly within the boundary of the image of myself. </p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/gstep2.png" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 3 - After I have completed a whole round around myself, I connect the line from my last node to the first node.After which clicking enter would apply my selection.</p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/gstep3.png" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 4 - In order to see the zoomed out image,I navigate to 'view' then 'zoom' and i select 'fit image in window' option.Here i can see a faint dashed line around my selection.To proceed with removing the background, i went to the 'select' tool at the top bar and clicked on 'invert'</p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/gstep4.png" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 5 - Next, clicking the 'edit' option and the option 'clear' removed the background and left just the selected part of myself.</p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/gstep5.png" width="850" alt=""/>
  <p>Step 6 - Finally, to save this project, I clicked on 'File' and 'export as'. To keep the transparent background, i had to select the file type and make sure that it was 'png' and then i labelled the file and saved it. </p>

	<h3>2D - Inkscape</h3>
  <p></p>
	
	<h3>3D - Autodesk Fusion 360 Part 1</h3>
		<p>This is the exercise I will be sketching in Fusion 360.Here I'll explain how i did it. On a side note: I find the software quite simple to follow along as i have used Sketchup for my course.</p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/f Exercise 3.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 1 - First, I drew three straight lines according to the measurements given in the exercise. </p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep1.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 2 - Next, I picked the centre point and drew out a circle with the radius of 35mm.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep2.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 3 - In order to achieve the shape as shown in the exercise, i selected the trim tool to modify the current sketch i had.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep3.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 4 - When hovering over the line, it turns a darker colour. This way, i could identify the line i wanted to remove.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep4.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 5 - Similar to how i drew the first circle, I used the same centre point and drew out a second circle with a radius of 20mm.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep5.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 6 - For the next step, I decided to try out the 2-point rectangle instead of having to draw 4 lines out.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep6.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 7 - Using the grids in the backkground as a reference, i drew out the rectangle in the previous drawing i had.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep7.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 8 - The final sketch i had looks identical to the one given in the exercise.To complete it , I clicked the 'Finish Sketch'option at the top right.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/fstep8.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 9 - Since i had some experience with Sketchup, i tried to use the modifying tool 'extrude' to alter the sketch.</p>

		<h3>3D Autodesk Fusion 360 Part 2</h3>
	<p>This is the second exercise we had to do for fusion. I found this one a little more challenging and I had to think of creative ways to go about sketching this.</p>
	<img src="extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/f Exercise 4 .png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 1 - For this, I decided to start off with drawing a circle with the radius of 30mm.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep1.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 2 - Using the create tab at the top, I selected 'polygon' from there and used the 'circumscribed polygon'option.Similar to before, I used the same centre point of the circle and measured 20mm from the centre to one side of the polygon.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep2.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 3 - Next , I drew a straight line following the grids and typed in a distance of 129mm. I planned to use this as a temporary guide to find the centre of my other polygon and circle.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep3.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 4 - Then, I found the 'circumscribed polygon'option again to draw the polygon that measured 15mm from centre to side.I took an additional step of typing in the number of sides this time to 5. Then, i clicked it in order to place my sketch there.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep4.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 5 - After that, I used the same centre point to draw a circle of 20mm . I also added two vertical lines that serve as my temporary guides. One was 10mm and the other was 20mm long.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep5.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 6 - I used the '2-point rectangle' tool to draw a rectangle with the measurements of 70mm x 10mm.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep6.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 7 - Then, I used the circle tool to draw two circles in the rectangle with the edge touching the 10mm sides.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep7.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 8 - Similar to the first exercise, I used the modifying 'trim' tool and trimmed out the addition sides of the rectangle that i didn't want to keep.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep8.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 9 - After doing so, I used the other 20mm guide line and drew out two horizontal lines connecting the two circles previously drawn.I also deleted the previous 10mm guideline to prevent clustering the sketch.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep9.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 10 - To further clean up the sketch, i deleted the 20mm vertical guideline and after which the horizontal 129mm guideline before clicking the 'finish sketch'option.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep10.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 11- Then i clicked the 'extrude'option to make the shape 3D. However, i still had some changes to make.</p>
	<img src="../../Unnamed Site 2/extra github stuff/Wk3 doc/sfstep11.png" width="850" alt=""/>
		<p>Step 12 - Finally to curve out certain corners, I used the 'fillet' option and curved the four corners to achieve the final outcome that the exercise wanted.</p>
